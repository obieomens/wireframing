What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product — such as a website, mobile app, or software interface. It outlines the structure, layout, and key elements on a screen without focusing on design details like colors, fonts, or images.

It is like blueprint for user interface — much like how an architect sketches a building before construction begins.

✅1. Clarifies Functionality
Wireframes help teams understand how a product will work, not just how it looks. It defines what goes where and how elements interact.

✅ 2. Improves Communication
They act as a shared visual reference for stakeholders, designers, and developers — making collaboration more effective and reducing misunderstandings.

✅ 3. Saves Time and Cost
Identifying usability issues and structural flaws early (before high-fidelity design or coding begins) prevents costly rework later in the process.

✅ 4. Focuses on User Experience (UX)
Wireframing emphasizes usability and content hierarchy, ensuring that user journeys and information flow are intuitive and effective.

✅ 5. Supports Iterative Design
Quick to create and update, wireframes make it easy to gather feedback and make rapid changes before finalizing a design.
